# ts-config

Shared TypeScript compiler configuration for 2h2d repositories

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm test
npm run build
npm run pack:dry
```

## Packaging

`.github/npm-package-files` is the authoritative package-content allowlist used by the local release
command and both CI jobs. Update it whenever the intended published file set changes.

## Release staging

Repository setup:

1. When `new` creates the GitHub repository, it automatically protects `main` and `v*` tags and
   restricts `npm-publish` to `v*` tags without a deployment reviewer or administrator bypass.
2. Configure npm trusted publishing for `2h2d-co/ts-config` using
   `.github/workflows/publish.yml` and the `npm-publish` environment.
3. Replace `.github/release-signers` if release commits use a different SSH signing key.

If repository creation was skipped with `--no-github`, configure the branch, tag, and environment
controls manually.

Release flow:

1. Run `npm run release -- X.Y.Z` from a clean, synchronized `main`.
2. The release command builds the package from the staged Git index, records its SHA-256 in the
   SSH-signed release commit, rebuilds the commit to prove reproducibility, and creates a lightweight
   `vX.Y.Z` tag.
3. Inspect the commit and tag, then push them atomically with
   `git push --atomic origin main vX.Y.Z`.
4. A read-only CI job builds, tests, packs, and inspects the package without publishing credentials.
5. A separate credentialed job verifies the signed commit and exact package digest before attesting
   and staging that archive through npm trusted publishing.
6. Approve the staged package on npmjs.com or with `npm stage approve <stage-id>`.

Stable versions use `latest`; prereleases derive a non-`latest` dist-tag such as `alpha`, `beta`, or
`rc` from their first prerelease identifier.
